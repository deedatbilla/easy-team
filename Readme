# Project Name

## Overview

This project consists of a backend Node.js/Express application and a frontend Next.js application. The backend utilizes Prisma as the ORM for database interactions.

## Backend

The backend directory contains a Node.js/Express application. Prisma is used for database operations. To seed the database, run the following command:

```bash
npm run prisma db seed
```

To run the backend server locally, use the following command:

npm run dev
```

## Frontend

The frontend directory contains a Next.js application. This directory houses the code for the client-side of the application.

## Docker Compose

- Frontend (Next.js)

To start the Docker containers, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Usage
